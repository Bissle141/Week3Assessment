        <h1>Career Goals</h1>
        <p>Over the years my career gols have changed a lot. So instead of just telling you what they are now, lets take a walk down memory lane.</p>
            
        <section class="careerGoalsSec">
            <h2 class="timePeriod">Beginning of High School</h2>
            <h3 class="Goals">Goal: Writing</h3>
            <~p>Going into high school and for a long time before that, I wanted to be a writer. By the time I was a freshman I'd probobly written half a dozen or so books that will never see the light of day. <br><br>
            After a couple of years though, my young dreams of writing for a living got drilled out of me and I opted for a slightly more realistic goal, but one that also seemed genuinly interesting to me.</~p>

        <section class="careerGoalsSec">
            <h2 class="timePeriod">End of High School</h2>
            <h3 class="Goals">Goal: Game Development</h3>
            <p>Half way through high school I joined the robotics team as well as began taking a game design vocational class. With the influences of both I decided I wanted to strive to enter the video games industry and become a developer.<br> <br>
            This goal actually carried me through my final high school days and into college where I was working towards a computer science degree (which would have move flexibility should the worst transpire). But then covid hit and all my plans were derailed spectacularly.</p>

            <h2 class="timePeriod">Now</h2>
            <h3 class="Goals">Goal: Stability and comfort</h3>
            <p>After having all my plans derailed and having to just do whatever it took to get by, I am now just looking to find a job which is stable. I'm keeping things open, but am hoping to finish this course and get a job at one of the local tech companies as a developer.
